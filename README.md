Dad - Small:
I've been around this particular toy my entire life (45 years, now)... My dad made this in shop class while he was in high school back in the early 1960's... I still have it sitting on a shelf in my office. As an exercise to learn some SolidWorks, I thought it'd be cool thing to model up.

I've included pics of the actual toy in the renderings.

If you decide to build one of these, please let me know how it goes. I'm considering exporting some STEP files for a friend's 3D printer...

Update (21 Apr 2016):
Bought a 3D printer (Ultimaker 2+) this week. This is the first job through it...
Dad - Big:
Like the Small toy cannon, I've been around this thing my whole life. I think it was a kit my dad bought when he was in high school, or maybe a gift. I dunno. Anyway, I just spent the day modelling it as a tool for learning solidworks.

Picket:

I modeled this little cannon based off the images on wikipedia:

Just a fun little exercise in keeping my (somewhat lacking) skills from getting stale.

Modeled in Solidworks 2018
gcode files are for an Ultimaker 2
